  5.1 Sightseekr reserves the right to log, monitor, fingerprint, and otherwise track access to the Rendered Map and repository in order to detect unauthorized access or copying of Source Code and Assets (including IP addresses, device identifiers, and browser metadata).
  5.2 If unauthorized use is suspected, you must cooperate with any compliance or audit request and provide any information reasonably required to demonstrate lawful use or deletion of infringing content.

6. Retroactive Liability
